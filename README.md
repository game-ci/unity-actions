## Setup

#### Mental model

There are two parts to setting up Unity Actions;

- Understand how Github Actions works
- Configuring a license from Unity
- Setting up a workflow for your project

**Detailed setup instructions can be found in the [docs](https://unity-ci.com/docs) at [unity-ci.com](https://unity-ci.com).**

#### First time using GitHub Actions?

Read the official documentation on how to setup a 
[workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow).

Any subsequent steps assume you have read the above.  

### Setting up license

All actions utilize an installment of Unity, and as such need to be activated.

It's generally considered good practice to use the same Unity version for Unity Actions as you do to develop your project.

To set up your license for use in Unity Actions, create a file called 
`.github/workflows/activate.yml` in your repository and follow the steps for 
either `personal` or `professoinal` license below.

##### Personal license
 
1. Request your activation file for usage on GitHub using
   [Request Manual Activation File](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file).
3. Request your license on 
   [license.unity3d.com](https://license.unity3d.com/manual).
4. Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets`
5. Create a secret called `UNITY_LICENSE` and add the contents of the obtained license file.

##### Professional license

1. Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets`
2. Create the following secrets;
    - `UNITY_SERIAL` - _(Add the code that looks like `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)_
    - `UNITY_EMAIL` - _(Add the email address that you use to login to Unity)_
    - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - _(Add the password that you use to login to Unity)_

##### Optional steps

- Verify your license using 
  [Activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-activate)
  and for pro licenses also 
    [Return License](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-return-license). This is to free up the license allocation after usage.

    > _Note: Test runner and Builder already include these steps._

### Setting up a workflow

Setting up a workflow is easy!

Create a file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository and configure the following steps;

1. Checkout a repository using
 [Checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout).
2. Cache your library folder using 
[Cache](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).
3. Configure your test job using 
 [Test Runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-test-runner).
4. Configure your build job using 
 [Builder](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-builder). 
5. Deploy your application.

Detailed instructions for each step can be found in the corresponding actions.

## Simple example

Below is a simple example. It is __recommended__ to start from here.
 
This example assumes that your Unity project is in the root of your repository.

> _Note: this repository tests this workflow_
>
```yaml
name: Actions 😎

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [master] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build my project ✨
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    
      # Checkout
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true
    
      # Cache
      - uses: actions/cache@v1.1.0
        with:
          path: Library
          key: Library

      # Test
      - name: Run tests
        uses: webbertakken/unity-test-runner@v1.3
        with:
          unityVersion: 2019.2.11f1

      # Build
      - name: Build project
        uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@v0.10
        with:
          unityVersion: 2019.2.11f1
          targetPlatform: WebGL 

      # Output 
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: Build
          path: build
```

## Advanced example

To get an idea of how to create a more advanced workflows,
have a look at the example below.

> _Note: this repository tests this workflow_

```yaml
name: Actions 😎

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [master] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  buildAndTestForSomePlatforms:
    name: Build for ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }} on version ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        projectPath:
          - test-project
        unityVersion:
          - 2019.2.11f1
        targetPlatform:
          - StandaloneOSX # Build a macOS standalone (Intel 64-bit).
          - StandaloneWindows64 # Build a Windows 64-bit standalone.
          - StandaloneLinux64 # Build a Linux 64-bit standalone.
          - iOS # Build an iOS player.
          - WebGL # WebGL.
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true
      - uses: actions/cache@v1.1.0
        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}/Library
          key: Library-${{ matrix.projectPath }}-${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
          restore-keys: |

      - uses: webbertakken/unity-test-runner@v1.3
        id: testRunner
        with:
          projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
