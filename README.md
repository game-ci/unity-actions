# Unity Actions

[![Actions status](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-actions/workflows/Actions%20%F0%9F%98%8E/badge.svg?event=push&branch=master)](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-actions/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush+workflow%3A"Actions%20%F0%9F%98%8E")

---

The fastest and **easiest** way to automatically test and build any Unity project!

---

#### Supported versions

It's generally considered good practice to use the same unity version for Unity Actions as you do to develop your project.

Check the [list](https://hub.docker.com/r/gableroux/unity3d/tags) of supported versions by Unity Actions. 

## Setup

##### Mental model

There are two parts to setting up Unity Actions;

- Configuring a license
- Setting up a workflow

Both steps are described in detail below;

##### First time using GitHub Actions?

Read the official documentation on how to setup a 
[workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow).

Any subsequent steps assume you have read the above.

#### Setting up license

All actions utilize an installment of Unity, and as such need to be activated.

To set up your license for use in Unity Actions, create a file called 
`.github/workflows/activate.yml` in your repository and follow the steps for 
either `personal` or `professoinal` license below.

##### Personal license
 
1. Request your activation file for usage on GitHub using
   [Request Manual Activation File](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file).
3. Request your license on 
   [license.unity3d.com](https://license.unity3d.com/manual).
4. Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets` and set the contents of the resulting license file to `UNITY_LICENSE` as a secret.

##### Professional license

1. Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets` and create the following secrets;
    - `UNITY_SERIAL` - _(Add the code that looks like `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)_
    - `UNITY_EMAIL` - _(Add the email address that you use to login to Unity)_
    - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - _(Add the password that you use to login to Unity)_

##### Optional steps

- Verify your license using 
  [Activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-activate)
  and for pro licenses also 
    [Return License](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-return-license). This is to free up the license allocation after usage.

    > Note: Test runner and Builder already include these steps.

#### Setting up a workflow

Setting up a workflow is easy!

Create a file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository and configure the following steps;

1. Checkout a repository using
 [Checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout).
2. Cache your library folder using 
[Cache](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).
3. Configure your test job using 
 [Test Runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-test-runner).
4. Configure your build job using 
 [Builder](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-builder). 
5. Deploy your application.

Detailed instructions for each step can be found in the corresponding actions.

#### Example

Below is a simple example.
 
This example assumes that your Unity project is in the root of your repository.

```yaml
name: Actions üòé

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [master] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build my project ‚ú®
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    
      # Checkout
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true
    
      # Cache
      - uses: actions/cache@v1.1.0
        with:
          path: Library
          key: Library

      # Test
      - name: Run tests
        uses: webbertakken/unity-test-runner@v1.2
        with:
          unityVersion: 2019.2.11f1

      # Build
      - name: Build project
        uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@v0.9
        with:
          unityVersion: 2019.2.11f1
          targetPlatform: WebGL 

      # Output 
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: Build
          path: build
```
