Github actions for testing and building Unity projects.  🦄

Contributions are welcomed!

## Workflow steps

Here's a complete mental model of how to build, test and deploy your Unity app.
 
1. Checkout your repository
2. Configure `request activation file` job.
3. Activate your license and 
[add](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-request-manual-activation-file)
the environment variable `UNITY_LICENSE`.
    - Optionally verify your license using `Activate licence` job.
4. Configure your test jobs.
5. Create builds for your desired targets.
6. Deploy your application.

Detailed instructions can be found in each action below.
